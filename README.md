🐝 Honeypot Cybersecurity Portfolio
Welcome to my Honeypot project portfolio. This repository demonstrates the design, deployment, and analysis of a cybersecurity honeypot used to detect, log, and study malicious activities in a controlled environment.

📌 Project Overview
A honeypot is a decoy system or service set up to attract and study cyber attackers. This project simulates vulnerable systems to:

Detect and analyze intrusion attempts

Study attacker behavior and tactics

Enhance threat intelligence

Improve defensive strategies

This portfolio includes configuration files, deployment scripts, and analysis reports from real-world attack data.

🧰 Tools & Technologies
Category	Tools / Technologies Used
Honeypots	SSH/Telnet Traps
Environment	Ubuntu Server
Logging	Text-Based Logs
Scripting	Python, Bash

🧪 Deployment Guide
Clone the repo

git clone https://github.com/D0up4/Honeypot
cd honeypot-portfolio
Set up the environment
Follow the setup guide:

Run the honeypot
Depending on the tool (e.g., Docker + Cowrie)

In Command Prompt:

python ssh_honeypot.py
And you should see:
[+] SSH Honeypot listening on port 22

On attacker side, In Command Prompt:
telnet 0.0.0.0 (replace with actual host ip) 22 (or any other port its hosted on)
